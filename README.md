# Workbench

Playground for GNOME development

![](data/screenshot.png)

Workbench aims to provide a great developer experience for the following use cases

1. An application to learn GNOME development - learning by doing with an instant feedback loop
2. A stratchpad for experienced developers who want to try or prototype something quickly

Workbench will never be a full fledged IDE or code editor. I see it as the little brother of [GNOME Builder](https://apps.gnome.org/app/org.gnome.Builder/).

Features:

* Live GTK/CSS preview
* [GNOME JavaScript](https://gjs.guide/) for quick and easy scripting
* Syntax highlighting
* Opens `.js`, `.css` and `.ui` files
* Auto format
* [More to come](https://github.com/sonnyp/Workbench/issues)

Workbench is a work in progress, [feedback and help welcome](https://github.com/sonnyp/Workbench/discussions/new).
